              Payment and Subscription

            <p>
              By subscribing to Capt’n.ai, you agree to the following terms and
              conditions:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul className='list-decimal pl-6'>
              <li>
                <b>Subscription:</b> Capt’n.ai is offered on a subscription
                basis. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic
                basis (each period is referred to as a "billing cycle"). Billing
                cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on
                the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Payments:</b> All payments are processed by our payment
                partner, Stripe. By providing a payment method, you expressly
                authorize us and Stripe to charge the subscription fees at the
                start of every billing cycle.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>No Refunds:</b> Payments are non-refundable and there are no
                refunds or credits for partially used periods. Following any
                cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to your
                subscription through the end of your current billing cycle.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Cancellation:</b> You can cancel your subscription at any
                time. Please note that you must cancel your subscription before
                it renews for a subsequent billing cycle in order to avoid being
                charged for the next billing cycle.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Changes:</b> We reserve the right to change our subscription
                plans or adjust pricing for our service in any manner and at any
