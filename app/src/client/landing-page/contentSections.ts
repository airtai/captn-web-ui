    question: 'How much does Capt‚Äôn.ai cost?',
    answer:
      'During its beta phase, Capt‚Äôn.ai is offered free for an entire month, allowing you to explore its features without any cost. This period is intended for gathering your feedback, so all associated costs are covered by us during this time. While creating an account requires a subscription to facilitate connection with your Google Ads account, providing credit card details is not necessary. The basic monthly subscription fee is currently set at $29, however, we are still evaluating the pricing model to determine if adjustments are needed, either to increase or even possibly decrease the fee. In any case, you will enjoy a 30-day free trial, after which we will have refined our pricing strategy and will inform you before the trial ends. This gives you the opportunity to assess the value of Capt‚Äôn.ai and decide if you wish to continue using the service.',
